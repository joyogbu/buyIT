##Installation
This application was created using a wide range of resources including the following:
* Python3
* flask
* sqlalchemy
* mysqldb
You can check the **requirements.txt**  for a full list of resources
##Usage
I implemented a database with 4 tables - **products**, **customers**, **cartitems**, and **shipping**
To manage the CRUD - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, I created the **console.py** which works as a command line interpreter, from where you can create, read, update and delete items from database tables.
For example to add a new product
